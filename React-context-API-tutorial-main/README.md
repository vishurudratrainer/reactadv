## React Context API vs Redux

Redux maintainer, Mark Erikson, gives the following reasons for using Redux:

- Consistent architectural patterns
- Debugging capabilities
- Middleware
- Addons and extensibility
- Cross-platform and cross-framework usage
- Depending on your app's setup, much better performance than working with just Context (we don't have to worry about the rerender problem we get with context, mentioned above â€“ coponents only rerender when the value they are using updates)
